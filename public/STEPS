*receiver*
- onicecandidate
  - send candidate to other guy
- ontrack (obviously not needed for data)
  - set the video object
- signaling.onmessage
  - if desc
    - if offer
      - setRemoteDescription to the offer
      - set local description to createAnswer
      - send local description to other guy
    - if answer
      - setRemoteDescription
  - if candidate
    - addIceCandidate
! receiver does not have an onnegotiationneeded event callback
  - so basically the sender is the one that kicks all this off

*sender*
- onicecandidate
  - send candidate to the other guy
- onnegotiationneeded
  - This is what kicks things off
  - setlocaldescription based on createOffer
  - send localdescription (which now has the createOffer in it) to the other guy
- signaling.onmessage
  ! IDENTICAL to receiver
  - behaviour is just different because of the cases the sender/receiver falls into
    based on message types
- ontrack (obviously not needed)


*interpreted steps of mine*
- sender onnegotiationneeded fired
- sender sets local description to a createOffer
- sender sends local description to receiver (in the desc field of a JSON)
- receiver gets a message, checks the desc field, its an offer
- receiver sets its remote description to the offer
- receiver sets its local description to createAnswer
- receiver sends its local description to sender (in the desc field)
- sender gets a message, checks the desc field, its an answer
- sender sets its remote description to the answer


*orig* - translated to our vernacular
- sender creates an offer
- sender sets its local description to that offerS
- receiver sets its remote description to receiver's local description
- receiver creates an answer
- receiver sets its local description to that answer
- sender sets its remote description to receiver's local description

*orig*
- local creates an offer
- local sets its local description to that offerS
- remote sets its remote description to local's local description
- remote creates an answer
- remote sets its local description to that answer
- local sets its remote description to remote's local description
